  Hi, my name's Mohammed Sharafath and I'm a research scientist currently pursuing my Ph.D. in machine learning. I also have leadership experience in developing Python packages, developing custom solutions for our industrial partners, and mentoring students in their master thesis. I have worked at a few of companies gaining experience in leadership and number-crunching skills.
  
  I am skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, and its associated data science packages like <mark>NumPy</mark>, <mark>pandas</mark>, <mark>PyTorch</mark>, <mark>TensorFlow</mark>, <mark>Scikit-learn</mark>, <mark>PyG</mark>, <mark>DVC</mark>, <mark>Optuna</mark>, <mark>Matplotlib</mark>, <mark>Seaborn</mark>. Further, I have additional experience in <mark>MATLAB</mark>, <mark>MySQL</mark>, <mark>Google Colab</mark>, <mark>AWS</mark>, and <mark>Gitlab</mark>.

  My data science experience includes <mark>Time series analysis</mark>, <mark>Image Classification</mark>, <mark>Graph Neural Networks</mark>, and <mark>Reinforcement Learning</mark> in task planning and robotics.

          An algorithmic plug-in that can be used on top of any gradient-based learning system.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          One of the first research projects that I carried out for my Ph.D. It works by controlling gradient fluctuations during back-propagation and enables stable and faster learning.
          The biggest advantage is that this can be used as plug-in on top of any gradient-based system, and immediately realize gains in the neural network performance.

          In reinforcement learning, having a stable environment that an agent can learn from is a crucial part of the research.
          Over the course of my research work, I developed a few environments for both robotics and digital twin applications.
          Granted, this is not the complete list as the major ones were developed for companies, which I cannot publish here. 
          But, I think this showcases my capabilities to develop usable code from complex ideas in domains like physics, operations research, and robotics.

          The Promotionskolleg NRW (PK NRW) bundles the scientific competencies of the universities of applied sciences in North Rhine-Westphalia and offers young scientists an excellent environment for academic qualification.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my time at PK NRW I learnt most of the key skills that I such as leadership, teamwork, and working to tight deadlines.
          I thoroughly enjoyed my time conducting research, exploring new avenues for improvement, and in general about the need for positive collaboration with researchers from a variety of other domains.

          The FH Suedwestfalen looks back on a long history - its historically oldest predecessor was founded in 1824. It has existed in its current form since 2002 through the merger of the Maerkische Fachhochschule with the Meschede and Soest departments of the Gesamthochschule Paderborn.

          The master's was my gateway into machine learning after working in the manufacturing industry for 5 years. Doing a master's after being in the industry for so long was a difficult choice. But I do not regret choosing to do it in the slightest.
          I learnt about a lot of exciting new technologies in production systems, control systems, and of course, also machine learning.
