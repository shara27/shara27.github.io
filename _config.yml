  Hi, my name's Mohammed Sharafath and I'm a research scientist currently pursuing my Ph.D. in machine learning. I also have leadership experience in developing Python packages, developing custom solutions for our industrial partners, and mentoring students in their master thesis. I have worked at a few of companies gaining experience in leadership and number-crunching skills.
  
  I am skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, and its associated data science packages like <mark>NumPy</mark>, <mark>pandas</mark>, <mark>PyTorch</mark>, <mark>TensorFlow</mark>, <mark>Scikit-learn</mark>, <mark>PyG</mark>, <mark>DVC</mark>, <mark>Optuna</mark>, <mark>Matplotlib</mark>, <mark>Seaborn</mark>. Further, I have additional experience in <mark>MATLAB</mark>, <mark>MySQL</mark>, <mark>Google Colab</mark>, <mark>AWS</mark>, and <mark>Gitlab</mark>.

  My data science experience includes <mark>Time series analysis</mark>, <mark>Image Classification</mark>, <mark>Graph Neural Networks</mark>, and <mark>Reinforcement Learning</mark> in task planning and robotics.

          An algorithmic plug-in that can be used on top of any gradient-based learning system.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          One of the first research projects that I carried out for my Ph.D. It works by controlling gradient fluctuations during back-propagation and enables stable and faster learning.
          The biggest advantage is that this can be used as plug-in on top of any gradient-based system, and immediately realize gains in the neural network performance.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
